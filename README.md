# Excel-VBA Project - The VBA of Wall Street
* I created a script that looped through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

### CHALLENGES

1. My solution was able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 

2. I made the appropriate adjustments to my VBA script that allowed it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
